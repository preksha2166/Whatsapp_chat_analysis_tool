# WhatsApp Chat Analysis Tool

This project provides an in-depth analysis of WhatsApp chat exports. It allows users to extract insights, visualize activity trends, and analyze communication patterns from their chat data.

## Features

- **General Statistics**: Extract key metrics, including total messages, total words, media shared, links shared, and unique users.
- **Monthly and Daily Activity**: Visualize chat activity on a monthly and daily basis.
- **Activity Heatmap**: Analyze chat activity by day of the week and hour of the day.
- **Active Users**: Identify the most active participants in the chat.
- **Common Words**: Generate a word cloud and list of the most frequently used words, excluding stopwords.
